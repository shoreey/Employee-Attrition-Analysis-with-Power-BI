# Employee-Attrition-Analysis-with-Power-BI
Project Overview
This repository contains a Power BI dashboard that analyzes employee attrition and related demographic and work-related factors, utilizing an Excel dataset containing various employee metrics such as business travel, education field, marital status, performance ratings, and work-life balance. The project enables data visualization, trend analysis, and strategic insights into employee retention and satisfaction.

Key Features of the Power BI Dashboard:
Attrition Analysis:

Analyzed and visualized the attrition status (Yes for former employees, No for current employees) across different factors such as departments, genders, job roles, and more.
Demographic and Employment Data:

Employee data includes attributes like:
Age, Marital Status, Gender, Business Travel, Employee Education, Job Role, etc.
Key attributes include Employee Count, Monthly Income, Job Satisfaction, and Work-Life Balance.
Visualizations:

A series of charts and visuals, such as:
Pie charts and bar graphs to showcase the proportion of employees leaving (Attrition Yes) vs. those staying (Attrition No).
Employee turnover trends by gender, job roles, education field, and business travel patterns.
Detailed comparison of Employee Count in various departments, across job levels, and environment satisfaction.
Insights:

Insights on which factors (e.g., Job Level, Age, Education) correlate with higher attrition rates.
Sex Ratio of employees calculated by comparing male vs. female employees, providing valuable demographic insights.
Dataset Description:
The dataset comprises several columns, including:

Attrition: Indicates whether an employee has left the company (Yes) or stayed (No).
Business Travel: Categorizes employees based on frequency of travel (e.g., Travel_Rarely, Travel_Frequently).
Age Band: Groups employees by age range (e.g., 35-44, 45-54).
Gender: Represents employee gender (Male, Female).
Education: Lists employees' highest education level (e.g., High School, Master's Degree).
Job Role: Defines employee's role in the company (e.g., Sales Executive, Research Scientist).
Job Satisfaction, Work Life Balance, Monthly Income, etc.: These columns represent various metrics that influence employee satisfaction and retention.
Purpose of Dashboard:
Evaluate Employee Retention: The dashboard allows for a deep dive into employee retention rates, identifying potential causes of attrition.
Demographic Insights: Helps understand employee demographics and how they correlate with attrition (e.g., whether males, younger employees, or employees in certain job roles are more likely to leave).
Trends: Provides insights into business travel, education levels, and department satisfaction.
Steps Taken for Dashboard Creation:
Data Cleaning:

The dataset was cleaned for nulls, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
Gender was encoded as 1 for male and 0 for female, allowing sex ratio analysis.
Measure Calculation:

Measures were created for Attrition Rate, Total Employees, and various breakdowns based on the Gender column and other relevant demographic fields.
Visualization & Interactivity:

Multiple visualizations and filters were applied to provide comprehensive views of the data.
Key metrics, such as Attrition Rate, Total Employees, and departmental breakdowns, were featured.
Users can interact with the dashboard by selecting categories and exploring deeper layers of the data (e.g., exploring attrition trends across different age bands or job roles).
KPIs and Dashboards:

Visual KPIs for Attrition Rate and Current vs. Former Employees were created to quickly assess organizational health regarding retention.
Trend charts illustrate how employee attrition varies over different timespans (by years or months).
Future Improvements
Advanced Predictive Models: In the future, machine learning models could be integrated to predict attrition based on historical trends.
More Data Points: Enrich the dataset with more demographic details (e.g., tenure, previous job performance) to gain more actionable insights.
